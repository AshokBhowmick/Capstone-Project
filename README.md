# Capstone-Project
This work is being carried out for the Capstone Project on a medical data of Electroencephalogram (EEG) records of Epileptic cases. 
The data has 178 feature and a class variable with 5 classes. 
It has a total of 11500 instances.
Class 1 represents epileptic or seizure cases while 2,3,4,5 are nonepileptic but various conditonal cases.
Task: Machine learning / Clustering and Classification. 
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The R code shows processing of the data file, Logistic regression for feature selection.
R code also shows Principal Component Analysis and GLMulti classification.
A clustering and hirearchical clustering Python code is done to understand the class values of the data as published. 
Python codes shows, Decision Tree, KNN, on selected features as well as on Principal components.
Python code also shows XGBoost and Random Forest Classifiation on comparative classes.
